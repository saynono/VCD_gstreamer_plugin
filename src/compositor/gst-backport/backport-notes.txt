The code in here contains backported parts from GStreamer 1.6. Specifically, the GstAggregator and GstVideoAggregator code has been copied.
This has been done to avoid a dependency on GStreamer >= 1.6. Right now it is too soon for such a dependency.
The classes and functions were renamed to use the prefix "GstImxBP" instead of just "Gst", to avoid name collisions if anybody uses gstreamer-imx
with GStreamer >= 1.6. (The "BP" in "ImxBP" mean "backport.")

Taken from gst-plugins-bad git head 86f6b83d7f4146baa6b92a8f7353e4a2d6daa746 .

The other modifications are:
* Added a couple of G_GNUC_UNUSED macros to suppress redundant warnings
* Removed the video converter code from the video aggregator
* Disabled the "unstable API" warnings
